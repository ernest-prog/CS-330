How do I approach designing software?
My initial approach to designing software starts with planning and usually a story board. I like to draw out my ideas before designing them. 
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I now have a better understanding of some computational graphics designs and more knowledge on C++. I feel I have a basic understanding of how to operate and what I am looking for.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
I didn't really have a process due to some of the code already being completed so the simplest thing for me to do was continously read the code and apply what was being asked to be implemented.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Being agile is crucial. I will not always be designing software from scratch.
How do I approach developing programs?
Developing programs have a structure and flow of which they follow.Drawing out ideas and ensuring we have a great understanding of what needs to be developed plays is my first step to developing programs.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
A new strategy I used was understanding how X & Y vertices work to create a visual. 
How did iteration factor into your development?
I struggled with iteration and understanding what we being requested.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I was able to get the point in my project via 3rd party resources and a ton of trial and error.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goal as a Product Manager is leveraged by understanding software lifecycles.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Understanding these skills helps me in my future classes with more practice and greater knowledge of system programs I might operate in the future.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
It's a new skill that I probably won't use unless I go into game development which i don't plan to but it's a cool skill to have.
